This fun series, written for children of 10-12 for the University of Edinburghâ€™s summer schools, explores how and why language has evolved through the centuries. Our protagonist Barbara encounters and attempts to chat with with her cavemen predecessors, chimpanzees, and a parrot, to mixed results.

Written by my colleague Laurie Harris, my role here was to work up the initial character sketches, before animating and overseeing post-production on the films, including directing the voiceovers and audio mix aswell as illustration and animation, primarily using DUIK for the character animation.
