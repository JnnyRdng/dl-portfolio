# This is a heading!

I can put text here and it appears in a special Paragraph component. Long text needs to be broken up a little bit or it'll just look like a big fat blob. I don't know what I'm typing at the moment but I always prefer real text over lorem ipsum, even if it just means I've got to randomly write some words down. My brain is just pouring these words into my fingertips and here. we. go!

Mental that this can happen. Just splurge some words down and they appear on the computer. Is there a tiny man living inside my keyboard who shouts my orders over to the computer? I like to think so.
