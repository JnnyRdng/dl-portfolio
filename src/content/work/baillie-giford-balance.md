An animation created for recruitment within Baillie Gifford - an international investment firm based in Edinburgh - this film aimed to capture the breadth of experiences that applicants could have in both their careers in Baillie Gifford, and their lives in Edinburgh.

By mixing up new styles with each new scene, we aimed to drive home this sense of diversity, flexibility, and range of experiences offered by the company, using fun metaphors to get across ideas like feeling part of a team, experiencing the city and Edinburghâ€™s culture.

My role was to work up and render ideas and animated sequences and scenes across the film, from frame by frame animations to full 3D shots. The piece won the gold award at the Scottish Design Awards.
