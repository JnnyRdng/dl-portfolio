I was lucky enough to be approached by Chillhop to work on animated renditions of their logo, which could be overlaid on top of a range of videos and social assets to introduce new tracks and content.

In collaboration with Chillhop, I worked up three distinct logo stings, that used cel animation, via photoshop, to bring the logo to life in ways that were fun, but that retained the chill core of Chillhop’s brand and music. Each video was made to reflect a different element of Chillhop’s chill empire - paint like fireworks burst in one sting, birds and clouds drift mystically in another, and fish and sealife bubble in the third.

The files were provided as simplified AE project files, stripped down to only the editable elements, which meant that the Chillhop team could tweak timings and colours further down the line.
