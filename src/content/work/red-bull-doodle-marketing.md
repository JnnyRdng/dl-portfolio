Where does your imagination take you? This international campaign, targeted at global markets, was created with the aim of drumming up interest from students around the world in applying for the annual Doodle Art event, leading to a huge grand finale in Amsterdam.

I directed the project from start to finish, overseeing the initial development and storyboards, the shoot itself, and post production.

Opening in live action as we push in on a young budding artist scribbling away, we swiftly transition into a fantastical animated world, where our artist is flying through a landscape of their own crazy, animated scribbles, before landing in the event space of the grand final.

One particular challenge of this project was the delivery of over 50 different outputs of varying durations and formats, for use across global Red Bull channels, with four different versions of the main film, using actors to suit different markets. This also involved the creation of clean project files that could be easily adapted by Red Bull film teams across the world, stripping the project files back so that only text layers needed to be edited, with no knock-on effects on the rest of the video.

With an extremely tight turnaround, this was a difficult project to pull off, with the team putting in a huge and valuable shift to deliver the project in a challenging timeframe.
