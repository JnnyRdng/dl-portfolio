Working with limited budget, we devised a format combining beautiful illustrations with slick, minimalist animation, before bringing to life archival in a magical but authentic, DIY way. We combined stop motion, minimalist, videogame-cutscene inspired animations, and live action to create a fresh feeling series that captures and brings to life the drama of the plagues, witch trials, and battles that we were depicting.
