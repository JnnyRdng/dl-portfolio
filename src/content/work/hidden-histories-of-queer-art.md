From treasure troves of queer artworks nearly lost to time, to secret symbols painted into artworks in plain sight, this series of three films explored the secret histories of queer life, joy, hidden within the history of art.

The series was extremely satisfying to work on, and racked up well over a million views on youtube. Featuring prominent queer art figures like Roxanna Halls and Horse McDonald, and made in collaboration with staff at the National Galleries of Scoltand, the series aimed to give voice to underrepresented groups and artists throughout history, highlighting the work of figures like Claude Cahun, Duncan Grant, or Anne Lister.

I researched and wrote the scripts, oversaw shoots and interviews, and oversaw and directly worked on the edits and animated sequence that brought these histories to life. The art direction was created in collaboration with Monika Stachowiak, reflecting the vibrance, energy, and visual motifs that recurred throughout our featured artworks.
