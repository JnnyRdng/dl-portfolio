Narrated by David Tennant, this series of short animations for BBC Bitesize used a wild variety of fun monsters to personify various forms of energy. We dreamt up Hydro, an old blocky Scottish gent made of stone with a waterfall for a beard, who described the process of hydro-power to our young audience, or Solar, a surly teen who springs to life when the sun comes out.

Working in collaboration with Laurie Harris, we sketched out and developed twelve different creatures that would cover the energy types that the BBC wanted described in the videos. From here we created storyboards and then illustrations that depicted the process of these energy types being created. This process involved a lot of research into accurately depicting different processes of creating energy, distilling complex processes like nuclear fusion and gravity batteries in a way that a young audience could understand.

In creating the animations, we used a network of freelancers from Iran, France, and Hungary, to cover the work required to create twelve videos. A highlight of the project was collaborating with David Tennant during the voice recording - he not only gave a great energy to the videos, but also lent his tones to the creatures themselves, flexing his range, whether the surfer-dude Geo, stinky Bio or the tempestuous Solar.
