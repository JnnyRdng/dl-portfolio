A dream project made in collaboration with Red Bull, here I was given access to the footage from some of Red Bull’s greatest stunts and asked to go wild, remixing the footage and combining it with cel animation and rotoscoping to give the impression that the stunts were dreamt up in a sketchpad, before leaping into their final, live action format.

These social assets were provided to global Red Bull teams, with the aim of drawing interest to the Red Bull’s international Doodle Art competition in Amsterdam. We created a series of five films, using photoshop, after effects, and a whole lot of frame by frame animation, The videos were launched all across Red Bull’s international channels.
