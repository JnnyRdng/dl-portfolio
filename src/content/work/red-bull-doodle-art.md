Where does your imagination take you? This international campaign, targeted at global markets, was created with the aim of drumming up interest from students around the world in applying for the annual Doodle Art event, leading to a huge grand finale in Amsterdam.

One particular challenge of this project was the delivery of over 50 different outputs of varying durations and formats, for use across global Red Bull channels. This also involved the creation of clean project files that could be easily adapted by Red Bull film teams across the world, stripping the project files back so
that only text layers needed to be edited, with no knock-on effects on the rest of the video.

With an extremely tight turnaround, this was a difficult project to pull off, and credit to the team for delivering under tricky circumstances.
