This fun animation was created to promote Trustifyâ€™s SMAIL product, which provides secure email encryption. The animation describes how email is one of the biggest entry points for cyber criminals - represented in a fun, accessible way with a hooded skeleton that recurs through the video.

The video was directed by myself and was I collaborated with a freelance animator to bring it to life.
