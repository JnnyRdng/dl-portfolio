This fun animation was created to promote Trustifyâ€™s SMAIL product, which provides secure email encryption. The animation describes how email is one of the biggest entry points for cyber criminals - represented in a fun, accessible way with a hooded skeleton that recurs throughout the video.

The video was directed and illustrated by myself, and I collaborated with a freelance animator - Gavin White - to bring it to life, with fun touches like a Mission Impossible-esque heist scene, and an email ticking time bomb.

The still frames above show three visual directions initially offered to the client. The style on the left was ultimately selected and developed.
