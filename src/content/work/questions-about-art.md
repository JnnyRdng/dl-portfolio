Why are there so few female artists? Why canâ€™t I touch art? Who decides what art is worth? 

I wrote, co-directed, and edited the majority of this suite of films, which were created in collaboration with curators, restorers, and other staff at the National Galleries of Scotland.

A particular highlight was the film about female artists, where we were able to illuminate lesser known artists like Gentileshi and Pheobe Anna Traquair, and explore the reasons behind the marginalisation of female artists in both history and the current art markets and spaces.

Despite a low budget, we were able to add fun animated sequences, infographics, and visual tricks to bring the artworks themselves to life, distilling key facts in a digestible way, and keeping up the energy to make these historical films feel fresh and contemporary.
