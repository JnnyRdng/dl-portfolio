This promo video, created for Busabout, a European Bus Tour company, uses motion graphics to showcase in a snappy and fun way the various routes and packages offered by Busabout across the continent.

Cutout imagery, animated maps and kinetic text form the basis of these videos, delivering a snappy, socials-friendly script without the need for a voiceover.

The video went on to form the basis for the Busabout Video Brand, with the style being rolled out across various short form video outputs.
