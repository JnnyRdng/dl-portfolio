I am a creative director with a decade of industry experience, specializing in projects that combine animation and live action in inventive, fresh ways, for global brands like **Red Bull** and **Lee Kum Kee**, alongside educational content for **BBC** and **National Galleries of Scotland**.

I am able to fully direct and oversee projects from start to finish, whilst also being hand-on in all stages of projects, from scriptwriting and research, to directing on shoots and in post, and to overseeing or directly working in After Effects, Premiere, and Cinema4D.

At Heehaw I have spent the majority of my 7 years at the company as Head of Animation and Illustration, directing a team of six creatives and additional freelancers, on international projects that have taken me from Cairo to Geneva to the Scottish Highlands and back.

Through my career, projects I have directed have won multiple awards including Best Animation at the Scottish Design Awards 2023 and 2022, Evcom Clarion Gold and Silver awards for Education and Diversity in 2021, and was nominated for Best Young Creative in Scotland at the Nods in 2017.
