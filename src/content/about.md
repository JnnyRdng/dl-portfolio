**Hi!** I am a creative director with a decade of industry experience, specializing in projects that combine animation and live action in inventive, fresh ways, for global brands like Red Bull and Lee Kum Kee, alongside educational content for companies like BBC Bitesize and the National Galleries of Scotland.

I am capable of fully directing and overseeing projects from start to finish, leading creatives and assembling teams, whilst also being hands-on throughout all stages of projects, starting with scriptwriting and research, through to directing on shoots, and finally overseeing or directly working on post-production in After Effects, Premiere, and Cinema4D.

At Heehaw in Edinburgh I have spent the majority of my 7 years at the company as Head of Animation and Illustration, directing a team of six creatives and additional freelancers, on international projects that have taken me from Cairo to Geneva to the Scottish Highlands and back.

I currently work as a freelance director and motion graphics artist, and work part time with Heehaw as Head of Animation.

Through my career, projects I have directed have won multiple awards including Best Animation at the Scottish Design Awards 2023 and 2022, Evcom Clarion Gold and Silver awards for Education and Diversity in 2021, and I was nominated for Best Young Creative in Scotland at the Nods in 2017.
